<p>This hardware project is based on my previous work involving a Looper device. A looper is able to record live audio and play it back instantly and indefinitely
The implementation of this project involves a hardware controller and a software audio server created using <a href="https://puredata.info">Puredata</a>
Throughout the developement there were numerous emulators created, latest of which is implemented in <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">ElectronJS</a> utilizing WebMIDI and my cross platform API used both by hardware and software versions of the controller</p>
